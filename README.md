# -Student-Performance-Analysis
An analysis of student performance in Portuguese and Math, using machine learning to predict final grades based on demographic, social, and school-related features.
# Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student performance in two Portuguese schools, using datasets for Mathematics and Portuguese language courses. The goal is to predict students' final grades (G3) based on various features.

## About The Project

This project explores student achievement in secondary education. The data includes student grades, demographic information, social factors, and school-related features. The analysis was conducted to understand the key factors influencing student success and to build predictive models for final grades.

### Built With
